# < Challenge five brain teaser >

## Description

Three weeks into my bootcamp of web development I can proudly say that I have surpassed myself from day one. Now I know that this is only the tip of the iceberg and there's so much more to learn and room to improve but, this challenge allowed me to continue my journey and this learning train will not stop here! Now in order to fully understand web API's I had to challenge myself by finishing this project on my own within a timeframe. Finished or not I'm turning in what I have because this action is sharpening my skills, efficiency, and speed. I have an understanding of how important computational thinking is in this field. If the only way you grow is by constantly pressuring yourself and staying out of your comfort zone, then challenges like this is the answer. Everyday I tap into a higher level of my self and am able to overcome imposter syndrome, resulting in being a better user with JavaScript.
